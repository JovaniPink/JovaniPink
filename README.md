## Hi there 😃, I'm Jovani Pink.

> Analytics Engineer and Data Integration specialists.

Analytics Engineer and Data Integration specialists who practice business awareness, taking business goals or problems and transforming them into a data model with software engineering principles and tools. I am interested in making information accessible for analytics, data science, and data movement (activation) with tools like BigQuery, Snowflake, CDPs, Looker, SQL, and Python. I am currently using the data engineering workflow of SQL, dbt Cloud, and Cloud Functionality (GCP/Snowpipe).

At the same time, success demands understanding the ins and outs of the organization’s business goals and looking at problems with healthy suspicion and curiosity in a collaborative and cross-functional environment. I enjoy the Agile process within a teamwork environment of working through issues, working on solutions with consistent communication, and sharing the building experience and perspectives.
