# Hi there 😃, I'm Jovani Pink

> Data Architect.

Experienced Software & Data Engineer specializing in **Cloud Architecture, Machine Learning, and AI**. I design and deliver scalable, cost-efficient cloud data platforms that turn business objectives into production-ready systems.

My work focuses on **data accessibility, machine learning operations, and AI activation**—bridging raw data to actionable insights. I have deep expertise in **Snowflake, BigQuery, and GCP**, with additional experience across **Azure (Cosmos, Service Bus, App Service)**, **SQL**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, and **Go**.

I currently partner with clients in regulated, data-intensive industries to build **compliant, resilient platforms** that balance innovation with governance and cost control.

Beyond technical execution, I take a **team-centric, product-minded approach**. I work directly with stakeholders to align data strategy with business strategy—ensuring that **teams, tools, and tasks support long-term innovation, safety, and measurable impact**.
